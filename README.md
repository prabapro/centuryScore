Using Bootstrap 4

# Notes

* html lang="zxx" must be used if Lorem ipsum texts are in use according to W3S validator. This must be changed to lang="en" once the real content is updated
* All non-bootstrap classes/IDs	will be prefixed as "cust-"
* UTF-8 & viewport meta must be placed for responsiveness
* FontAwesome suggest to place the JS in head section to load fast
* Custom style sheet must be placed next to Bootstrap CSS in order to over-write styles
* "ml-auto" means margin-left-auto - this will float the UL to right of nav bar
* Featured programs & the course items are designed with new Bootstrap 4 cards component
* Bootstrap JS must be placed after JQery & Popper JS (just before closing </body>)
* Popper JS to be used only if "Popovers" are being used in the code
